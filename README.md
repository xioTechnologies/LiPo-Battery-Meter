LiPo-Battery-Meter
==================

Battery meter for single cell [LiPo batteries](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/339) to display a battery voltage between 2.8 V to 4.2 V as an LED bar graph.  Uses the [LM3914](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12694).  The PCB has foot prints compatible with either ten 1206 LEDs or a [single LED bar graph package](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9935).  Inspired by [Dave Jone's tutorial](http://www.eevblog.com/2011/09/29/eevblog-204-designing-a-li-ion-battery-gauge-with-the-lm3914/).
